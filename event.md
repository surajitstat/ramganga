**Public talks**

On 2nd March 2021 at 16:00 IST, Prof. Rajiv Sinha took part in the Gyan Ganga/ VIPNET Tuesday Lecture Series by Vigyan Prasar, with a talk titled **"Protecting floodplains and riverine wetlands in the Ganga basin for fostering river health"**, followed by an interaction session. These are available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uz5tVF0dxg).

**Conference talks**

Dr. Surajit Ray presented a talk titled [**"Developing Statistical Downscaling to Improve Water Quality Understanding and Management in the Ramganga Sub-Basin"**](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=309219) at the session titled "Solving Environmental Problems Through Data Assimilation" as part of the 2020 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM 2020) on 6th August 2020. The slides are available [here](https://github.com/surajitstat/ramganga/files/6249888/JSM2020_slides.pdf).

Dr. Craig Wilkie presented a talk titled [**"Spatiotemporal statistical modelling of water quality within river networks"**](http://environmetrics.org/vc2020_program.html) at the session titled "Fresh Water Quality Monitoring and Analysis" as part of The International Environmetrics Society virtual conference (TIES 2020) on 4th December 2020. The slides are available [here](https://github.com/surajitstat/ramganga/files/6249867/TIES2020_slides.pdf).

**Workshop**

Dr. Surajit Ray organised the workshop titled **"Workshop on Future directions: Mathematical Sciences for GCRF Initiatives"**, held virtually on 19th to 21st October 2020 with the support of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS). The workshop allowed the discussion of opportunities for developing new collaborations within the mathematical sciences, specifically those meeting the needs addressed by the UK's Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF). Representatives from 8 research-focussed grants and 6 capacity-building-focussed grants attended. Slides from the Ramganga grant update are available [here](https://github.com/surajitstat/ramganga/files/6249958/grant_update_Ramganga.pdf).
